# JavaEntertainment ðŸŽ¬(First Java Project)

JavaEntertainment is a simple Java-based application that allows users to manage and retrieve information about entertainment content, including movies, TV series, and mini-series. This project was my first implementation in Java, focusing on object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, data handling, and user interaction.

# Features
1. Manage Entertainment Content: Add movies, series, and mini-series with relevant details (title, release year, genre, country, director, actors, etc.).
2. Update Series Information: Modify the number of seasons, episodes, or last airing year.
3. Search & Rate: Find content by title or release year and rate it (1-10).
4. Actor/Director Search: Find details about actors and directors, including their filmography and ratings.
5. User Authentication: Sign up and log in to rate content and save favorite actors/directors.

# Notes
The application does not store data permanently. All information is lost upon closing.
The application's messages are in greek.

This project helped me understand how Java works.
